# Mobile-device-for-Hydrogen-therapy
This is a repository for paper "Hydrogen Evolution and Dynamics in Hydrogel Electrochemical Cells for Ischemia-Reperfusion therapy".

This repo contains 
1. A flexible PCB designed for delivering constant current to the hydrogen producing device.
2. A user interface software code for wirelessly controlling the flexible PCB.
3. A code to plot hydrogen diffusion modelling data.
4. A code to analyze the hydrogen evolution video.

# System requirements
1. The flexible PCB design requires the installation of software KiCad 8.0 (https://www.kicad.org/download/). We use windows 64 bit system. The computer system requirements can be seen in https://www.kicad.org/help/system-requirements/.
